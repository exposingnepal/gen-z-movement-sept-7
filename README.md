## GenZ Movement

- Dead: Over 19 students, youths, and civilians. 
- Injured: Over 345

## What Happened
The protests ignited after the government decided to ban multiple social media platforms across the country. Gen Z took to the streets not merely over the ban, but in opposition to a government they view as having a long-standing record of failing to serve citizens—marked by outrageous bribery, corruption, and abuse of authority. Contrary to what some international outlets are reporting, this movement was never primarily about social media; that issue is the least of the agenda.

## Actors Involved 
The following individuals may attempt to deny, evade, conceal, resign, or otherwise deflect accountability. This document identifies them as responsible for decisions and actions associated with what many regard as one of the darkest days in Nepal’s recent history.

1. Prime Minister: Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli
2. Home Minister: Rakesh Lekhak. Directly responsible for internal security and deployment orders.
3. CDO of Kathmandu: Chhabilal Rijal
4. The Inspector General of Nepal Police, Chandra Kuber Khapung. Top police official, responsible for force-wide directives.

This was a cold, calculated, and methodical operation—planned, directed, and executed to instill fear among the public. The following roles share direct accountability for what unfolded:

1. Chief District Officers (CDOs) in Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, and Bharatpur. They signed and enforced curfew orders and authorized “force to disperse.”
2. Metropolitan Police Commissioners (e.g., Kathmandu Metropolitan Police Range). Responsible for field deployment strategies.
3. Superintendents of Police (SPs) / Deputy SPs. Commanding protest sites (Maitighar Mandala, New Baneshwor). They decide escalation levels (batons → tear gas → bullets).
4. Individual Officers & Soldiers. Those who discharged live rounds into crowds. In criminal law, pulling the trigger is not excused by the chain of command unless done to protect life.
5. Direct Perpetrators: Officers who fired live ammunition, beat protesters fatally, or caused lethal injuries.

All of the above should be subject to hearings before the appropriate judicial bodies and, where warranted, prosecuted under the Criminal Code for orchestrating or participating in genocide, homicide, and the killing of school children, and for inciting nationwide chaos and destruction.

## What Happened
Here's what and how the event unfolded: 

1. Chhabilal Rijal, the Chief District Officer (CDO) of Kathmandu, issued the order to open fire against anyone and everyone without prejudice. This primarily includes the GenZ who had taken on to begin a peaceful protest.
2. Riot control escalated, tear gas was deployed, live rounds were fired (not rubber bullets or blanks).
3. Protestors, children, and adults were shot on streets, with fatalities at or near the demonstration sites. 
4. Students in school uniform are shot, including a direct head shot, amongst others. 
5. Shots fired from inside the premises of the Constituent Assembly towards the protestors outside. 
6. Nepal Police stopped ambulances and rescue teams from evacuating injured and deceased individuals. 
7. Civilians (including women, children, and shopkeepers) were beaten or otherwise assaulted in and beyond protest zones.
8. Police forced entry into Civil Service Hospital in Baneshwor, Kathmandu, where patients receiving emergency care were shot, and volunteers, and blood donors were stopped from providing support and relief to those injured. 
9. Officers threatened the residents at night, raided their house, and opened fire at them. 
10. Officers beat women at night for no apparent reason of being a threat to their life. 
11. Nepal Police has been hitting women and children, anyone they please so, without any prejudice, day or night, morning or evening, in the scene and far away from the hostile place.
12. The Nepal Army remained inactive due to a lack of orders by the President of the Country. 
13. This is tyranny, anarchy, brutality, and abuse of authority.
14. Daughter of Deputy Mayor of Duhabi Municipality Menuka Pokhrel Khatidawa took onto Facebook with a post. She posts: "आज आन्दोलनमा ग्रिहमन्त्रि (रमेश लेखक-नेपाली कांग्रेस) को आदेश बमोजिम चलेको गोलि मलाई लागेको भए? सरकार को बिरोध गर्नु हुने थियो कि मौन बस्नु हुने थियो? नेपाली काॱग्रे्श लाई के भन्नु हुने थियो?". Translation: "Dear Mom! If I had been hit by a bullet fired on the orders of the Home Minister (Ramesh Lekhak-Nepali Congress) during the protest today, would I have protested against the government or remained silent? What would I have said to the Nepali Congress?"

## Civilians’ Appeal to International Media and Human Rights Bodies

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

We write with urgency to draw attention to grave human rights violations occurring in Nepal. Credible reports from today’s events indicate that security forces opened fire on student and youth demonstrators, including children in school uniforms. At least 19 people have been killed and hundreds injured (300+), with the toll still being updated. These actions demand immediate international scrutiny and protection measures. 

**Why this warrants urgent international attention:-**

What unfolded today engages core protections under international law:

(a) UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989)
- Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life; the State must ensure their survival and development to the maximum extent possible.
- Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.
- Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. 

(b) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, 1966)
- Article 6(1): Every human being has the inherent right to life; no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of life.
- Article 24(1): Children are entitled to measures of protection as minors. 

(c) Policing standards on the use of force
- UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms require necessity, proportionality, and precaution; lethal force is strictly limited to situations of imminent threat to life.
- UN Guidance on Less-Lethal Weapons further constrains crowd-control tools (e.g., kinetic impact projectiles, chemical irritants) and emphasizes medical access. 

**Our request:-**

We respectfully urge:
- Immediate, independent investigation under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council and relevant special procedures, focusing on (a) use of live ammunition against protesters, (b) treatment of children and students, and (c) any obstruction of medical care or rescue.
- Protective measures—including rapid monitoring, public reporting, and engagement with authorities to guarantee access for ambulances, medical personnel, and human rights observers.
- Accountability consistent with international standards where unlawful killings or ill-treatment are established, and safeguards to prevent reprisals against victims, witnesses, journalists, medical staff, and civil-society responders.
- Restoration of fundamental freedoms, including access to communication platforms consistent with human rights obligations, given the broader context in which the protests arose. 

Evidence:-

We are compiling photos, videos, medical notes, and verified media reports documenting casualties, treatment of students, crowd-control methods, and any impediments to emergency care. 

We, the citizens of the country, respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and every other other relevant body to launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors. Hoping for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian. 

Please help in saving the lives of the citizens of Nepal.

Respectfully,

Concerned Citizens of Nepal
